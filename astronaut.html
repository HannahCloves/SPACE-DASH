    <p> People go into space for all kinds of reasons, like exploring, doing research, or fixing spaceships like the
      ISS!</p>
    <p> There can be any number of people in space at any one time, working together as a team on missions. They keep in
      contact with everyone on earth through mission control, where they radio in, to let everyone on the ground know
      how they are doing.</em>
    <p> Working in space can be very dangerous, so the people who go up have to be both brave, and smart. Luckily they
      also have people watching out for them in missoin control, to make sure everything is alright.</em>
