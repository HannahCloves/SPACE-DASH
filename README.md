## Instalation 

#### APIs used:   
[Nasa](https://api.nasa.gov/)   
[The Solar System OpenData](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/)

Due to an insecure server usage we have had to stop using the ISS api and can no longer produce the information about the number of people in space or their details. We have changed this to feature the phases of the Moon. 

## Proposed

We are creating diffrent elements between the 4 members of our team, to bring together a commmon united learning resource for young learners.

We have chosen a common design and theme including a color scheme and wireframe / sketch of the chosen design. 

We need to endeavour to utilise and communicate as a team to make sure all seperate pages follow a common ground and look united at the presentation of the application.
